# The Debias Project
Articial intelligence is being driven by vast improvements in the topic of natural language processing. One of the more salient topics in natural language processing is the topic of bias. As individuals and technologies learn to leverage the power of language processing, preventing bias from weaving it's way into the technology will be an important subject to monitor. The Debias Project is a project served to inform designers, developers, and policy makers about the future of bias in natural language computation and processing. The goal is to grow and improve this page over time to improve the collection criteria, sorting and filtering, and to add other types of information important to the conversation about bias.
